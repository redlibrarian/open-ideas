What can Marx tell us about Climate Change.

Abstract:

For many years, the communist theory of Karl Marx was thought to be all
about the domination and exploitation of the Earth. Marx’s Communist
society would, it was assumed, be based on the same kind of industrial
progress that capitalism is, with all the ecological problems that go
along with it. Recently, however, a line of ecological thinking has been
discovered in Marx’s work, a line which was ignored throughout the 19th
and 20th centuries. In this talk, I will look at what ecological ideas
can be drawn from Marx’s political and economic work, the reason a
“Marxist ecology” seemed to be a contradiction in terms for so long, and
how Marxism can help us connect ecological struggles with other
struggles, such as anti-poverty, anti-fascist, and indigenous activism.
Marxism provides a theory of interlocking struggles which I hope to show
can help us fight against the exploitation of capitalist economics, the
real presence of man-made climate change, and other forms of power and
domination.
